```bash
sudo sed -i '/vitaldb.net/d' /etc/hosts

sudo sed -i '/vitaldb.net/d' /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.debian.tmpl

sudo systemctl restart vitalrecorder

sed -i edits a file in place; /vitaldb.net/d deletes every line containing that text.
```

This is how you would undo the block we put in to prevent the pi from handshaking with vitaldb servers
